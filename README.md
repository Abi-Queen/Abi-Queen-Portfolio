## Web Developer
I am a web developer excited to learn, innovate, and work with others on applications that will help empower individuals and bulid a better future. I also teach history at College of the Redwoods. When I'm not coding or time traveling, I like to play with my kids, cook, run, and enjoy my mountain home on the coast of Humbodlt County, California.
